When I created this repo, I didn't get a message like this: 
`<Organization>/.github is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add README.md to your public organization profile, visible to anyone
Make sure it’s public and and initialize it with a README in the profile directory to get started.`
May be the README.md only works for organizations. The README.md in the .github repo only works for .github repo in organization.
